# [Website - Animal Trading Cards](https://ninakwelch.github.io/trading-card-website/index.html#)

[Trading Cards Website](https://ninakwelch.github.io/trading-card-website/index.html#) is a collaborative project for students of [Udacity Google Developer Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships) started by [Nina Welch](https://github.com/NinaKWelch). 

## Resources

This website uses the following resources:
* Hosting by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* Framework by [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
* Templates by [Start Bootstrap](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap)
* Emojis by [Emoji CSS](https://afeld.github.io/emoji-css/)
* Social Icons by [Simple Icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons )

## In Development

### Pinterest style gallery for the cards

Current layout uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/) card-columns. 
There is an issue with box-shadow property: if box-shadow is wide it gets cropped on all other browsers apart from Firefox.
Maybe flexbox is a better option? To be explored...

## Ideas

* Create a slider for displaying cards like [example 1](https://tympanus.net/Development/3DGallery/index.html) or like [example 2](http://www.maisengasse.at/home/) that looks different from typical carousels or sliders
* Create different categories like cats, dogs, birds etc.

## Bugs and Issues

* How to use SVG images so that their color can be chaged without adding all the code to the HTML page

## About

The project was inspired by all the wonderful [Animal Trading Cards](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud304-emea/lessons/42d3d82e-6056-4162-9183-750d863c24f6/concepts/12cb8710-01aa-4c3f-9ed9-6c563cfddc7a) from the resourceful students at [Udacity Google Developer Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships). How amazing would it be, if we could see them all in one place!

I would love all of you get involved. Simplest way to contribute is to submit your card and have it displayed on the home page. If you would like to contribute some ideas, all the better.

For those who are dying to put their fresh javaScript skills to test - it would be soo fab to add some cool features. It’s a team effort!

To get things started, [let me know about your ideas](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/paw-prints-new-shared-project-for-everyone-to-take-part-in/523110) and what you’d like to do.
