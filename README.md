## Ideas

### Cards page:

Ranking - Ability to like a card
Question: Is this something that is useful or needed? Card styles could be displayed in the order of most liked.


### Fun stuff:

* Food chain feature - maybe not so fun but educational! Could be done as a separate page

**Comments about these and new ideas welcome!**

## Bugs and Issues

* There is an issue with box-shadow property: if box-shadow is wide it gets cropped on all other browsers apart from Firefox. Maybe flexbox is a better option? To be explored...
* Now that there are more cards and co-creators, the images are starting to load slower. Some kind of progressive loading could be a solution

## Contributors

* Contributors can be found on [Co-creators page](https://ninakwelch.github.io/trading-card-website/contributors.html)

## About

The project was inspired by all the wonderful **Animal Trading Cards** from the resourceful students at **Udacity Google Developer Challenge**. How amazing would it be, if we could see them all in one place!

I would love all of you get involved. Simplest way to contribute is to submit your card and have it displayed on the home page. If you would like to contribute some ideas, all the better.

For those who are dying to put their javaScript skills to test - it would be soo fab to add some cool features. It’s a team effort!

To get started, [let me know about your ideas](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/paw-prints-new-shared-project-for-everyone-to-take-part-in/523110) and what you’d like to do.
